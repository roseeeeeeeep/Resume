    \par Dear Hiring Manager,  \hfill \textbf{\today}
    \vspace*{10pt}
    \par I am delighted to be applying for the \roleName{}.
    \vspace*{10pt}
    \par I am a fourth-year Computer Engineering student in the Engineering Science program at Simon Fraser University. I have 
    previously completed a Bachelor of Science degree majoring in Physiology and Pharmacology at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon.
    Throughout my academics and past employment in professional work settings, I have developed excellent verbal and written communication skills. 
    Throughout my years at SFU, I have been involved with the Women in Engineering (WiE) club. Through this, I have created many meeting templates and led numerous event planning discussions. 
    WiE is a part of many events at SFU, but being a speaker for the annual Ecole Polytechnique Massacre Memorial is one of the most memorable for me. 
    Not only was I a part of a powerful conversation regarding gender-based violence, but I was able to showcase my new found confidence in public speaking. 
    \vspace*{10pt}
    \par Moreover, during my studies, I have developed a foundational understanding digital logic design, and VHDL and C/C++ programming languages. One of my accomplished projects from this year is the classic Snake game
    on the Xilinx Zedboard. This project reinforced my ability to communicate and make decisions effectively with a partner. 
    The most interesting part of developping this project was implementing a custom interrupt driven VGA block for real-time graphics, 
    and its integration with the rest of the system.
    \vspace*{10pt}
    \par I would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to express my interest in working alongside
    the talented Intel team. I believe my past experience, both academically and professionally makes
    me a unique fit for this position. I am available for 8 months. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me via email. I hope to hear from you
    soon. Thank you again for your consideration.
    \vspace*{10pt}
    \par Sincerely,
    \par Rose Epstein
