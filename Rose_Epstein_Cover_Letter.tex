    \par Dear Jason Buck and Firstline team,  \hfill \textbf{\today}
    \vspace*{10pt}
    \par I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my interest in joining Firstline's efforts to make reliable information more accessible to clinicians when they need it most.
    With my background in both computer engineering and physiology, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to a company that merges both technology adn healthcare to help patients.
    \vspace*{10pt}
    \par I completed my first degree in Physiology and Pharmacology at the University of Saskatchewan, where I developed a strong passion for the human body and health sciences. 
    Now, as a Computer Engineering student at Simon Fraser University, I have gained hands-on experience in software development, embedded systems, and digital circuit design. 
    I have worked at the board level with FPGAs, focusing on hardware-software integration for real-time systems, developing a solid understanding of digital logic design, VHDL, and C/C++ programming. 
    In addition to embedded development, I have also contributed to solely software projects involving system analysis and multi-threaded programming.
    \vspace*{10pt}
    \par What excites me most about Firstline is the opportunity to apply my technical skills in a healthcare-focused environment.
    Working at the intersection of healthcare and technology feels like the perfect way to bring both of my worlds together, and I would love the opportunity to contribute to your team.
    \vspace{10pt}
    \par I would like to thank you for the opportunity to express my interest in working alongside the talented Firstline team. 
    I'd appreciate the chance to connect and learn more about you and your team. Please let me know if you'd be open to a conversation. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!
    \vspace*{10pt}
    \par Sincerely,
    \par Rose Epstein


    %\par I am currently in my final year of Computer Engineering in the Engineering Science program at Simon Fraser University. I successfully
    %completed a Bachelor of Science degree, majoring in Physiology and Pharmacology at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon in the summer of 2020.
    %Throughout my academic journey and professional experiences, I have developed excellent verbal and written communication skills. 
    %During my time at SFU, I have been involved with the Women in Engineering (WiE) club. Through this, I have created meeting templates and led numerous event planning discussions. 
    %\vspace*{10pt}
    %\par As a lead organizer and event lead for an outreach initiative aimed at young female students in the Burnaby area, I led the planning and execution of a hands-on, tech-inspired workshop. 
    %The event was designed to engage and inspire participants through a fun and interactive build of motor-powered cars. 
    %By creating an encouraging environment, I saw young minds develop practical engineering skills while fostering a passion for technology and innovation.
    %but being a speaker for the annual Ecole Polytechnique Massacre Memorial is one of the most memorable for me. 
    %Not only was I a part of a powerful conversation regarding gender-based violence, but I was also able to showcase my new found confidence in public speaking. 
    %\vspace*{10pt}
    %\par Additionally, during my studies, I have developed a solid understanding of digital logic design, VHDL, and C/C++ programming languages. 
    %One of my notable projects from this year is a graphical application on the Xilinx Zedboard, our rendition of the classic Snake Game. This project reinforced 
    %my ability to communicate and make decisions effectively with a partner. The most interesting part of developing this project was implementing a 
    %custom interrupt-driven VGA IP block for real-time graphics and integrating it with the rest of the system.
    %\vspace*{10pt}
    %\par I would like to thank you for the opportunity to express my interest in working alongside
    %the talented Firstline team. I believe my past experience, both academically and professionally, makes
    %me a unique fit for this position. I am available for a 4- or 8-month term. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me via email. I hope to hear from you
    %soon. 
    %\vspace*{10pt}
    %\par Sincerely,
    %\par Rose Epstein
